		<h2 style="text-align:center">General Notes</h2>
		<ol style="display:inline-block; pointer-events:none">
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">The goal is to create an accurate mockup of the modern Lorenzana/Cisneros/Ortiz Gothic Office, not an one-to-one recreation of the given sources, nor of the ancient manuscripts.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">In 1502, the Mozarabic Breviary was published by Cardinal Cisneros, compiled by Alfonso Ortiz. In 1775, Cardinal Lorenzana republished a new edition, adding additional materials.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Sources are taken primarily from two places: the Gothic Breviary, and the Missa gothica, which contains the festal commons. The Mozarabic site offers the Breviary in web form, albeit with a few typos. Additional resources may be found on the site.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Secondary sources on the notes of the office comes from the Regula of the Breviarium and the introductory notes of the Missa gothica, the Catholic Encyclopedia, the 1593 and the 1603 notes.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Vespers has 3-4 antiphons/responsories, called Psalmi (Psalmus). In other literature, the first is sometimes called the Vespertinum or Lucernarium, and the last is sometimes called the Lauda with Alleluia or the Alleluiaticum.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">What the Breviarium calls the Capitula or Chapter is sometimes referred to as the Completuria.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Similarly, the Lauda cum Oratio, Commemoratio and Conclusion is sometimes referred as the Psallendum.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Sometimes the 3 antiphons at Matins are collectively called the <i>missa</i>. There is a theory that they used constitute the bulk of the psalms.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; background-color:#DDD; float:initial">A comparison of the responsory styles given <a style="padding:0px; display:inline; background-color:#DDD; pointer-events:auto" href="resp.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Lauds (like other rites) is properly the second half of Matins, and is only differentiated for convenience.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">1603 notes dictates that Lauds begins with a 'Dominus sit ...', but Missa gothica is silent about this. Not that it properly begins so, but this introduces the antiphon for the Canticle.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">At Lauds, the Lauda and following Blessing come from the previous Vespers.</li>
		<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial">On Sundays and Feasts, the same for Lauda cum Oratio.</li> -->
		<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial">The Breviarium is inconclusive on the position of the Blessing at Lauds when a Oratio is attached to a Lauda. It doesn't really envision an Oratio at all. Regula implies existence and position of the Blessing always at the end, before the Commemoratio. One thing is clear. If there is no Oratio following the Lauda (to which Dominus is added before), then the Blessing follows. If there is an Oratio that follows the Lauda, then the order is either Lauda-Blessing-Oratio (2nd day of January fast) or Blessing-Lauda-Oratio (Missa gothica, Agenda Mortuorum & Vespers). LOB is never directed. BLO is chosen when an Oratio follows the Lauda.</li> -->
		<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial">The Commemoratio comes at the end of Vespers and Lauds. Breviarium directs (Lauda. ... , P. ... ), but Missa gothica directs (P. ... , R. ... ). When 6 Capparum (sim. to duplex), it should not be said (Similar to Roman Suffrages).</li> -->
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Before the Blessing, it is called Humiliate vos ad benedictionem, on 1st, 4th Sundays of Advent. 3x. We can conclude it is wrong. Humiliate vos benedictioni will be used, as it is everywhere else.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Orations at Matins and Lauds should be preceded by a 'Dominus sit' (noted by CATHEN, 1603 and 1593: except Commemoratio and Matins prayer after Ã†terne). At Vespers, the Oratio is said without a Dominus sit. It is unknown if Dominus sit is said before the prayers of the Minor hours. The Missa gothica does not mention this at all; rather Orations at Matins simply follow the Antiphona without 'Dominus sit'. The guidelines from 1593 and 1603 are followed, hence Dominus ... before the Orations at Matins.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">The conclusion of Lauds is as follows: All the sources are unclear, and the Missa offers several options. Therefore, I have chosen to mirror Vespers, with two In NDJC ... , with an added Et fidelium ... (which itself varies). CATHEN states it ends as at Vespers.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Supplication: Breviarium begins with Oremus as the first word, but Missa gothica styles it as a Roman introduction. A period is added after Oremus, as per Missa gothica.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">From the Additional Notes, they also note that the Breviarium:</li>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square !important; overflow:visible; display:inline-block; pointer-events:none; margin-left:20px;">
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">It is not detailed. Ex. 148-149-150 is recited more or less daily.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Advent is six weeks, but only MWF is provided. For TRS, the previous days are repeated. (Unless a feast occurs)</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">It is difficult to use, due to constant page-turning and lack of precision. (Unwritten customs)</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Ferial Easter is not well defined, aside from the Octave.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">The minor hours are of the Monastic tradition. These are different from the minor hours on the Penitential days given throughout the Breviarium, which were Cathedral rite.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Compline is very complex, because Ortiz was not able to interpret the manuscripts.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">They note that the Missa gothica drops the variable parts and simplifies things.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Ferias and Penitential days begin with Matins, while Feasts and Sundays begin with Vespers.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">They note that in Lauds, sometimes an Oratio is directed. It seems, then, that the Oratio <i>replaces</i> the Blessing, though this is never explicitly stated. This has not been followed through here, and consequently, sometimes there is both a Blessing and an Oratio.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">More irregularities occur in ferial Lauds, esp. Lent.</li>
			<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial"></li> -->
			</ul>
		<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Consequently, the Blessings from the ferial Advent, where not directed, are planned to be removed.</li> -->
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Since the Breviarium is inconclusive about the position of the Blessing at Lauds when there is an Oratio, the decision is made to omit the Blessing, following the suggestion above. This way, Lauds always ends with either an Oratio or a Blessing.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">If one wishes to recite this office, but is not a priest, instead of Dominus sit ... , it can be replaced by <i>Domine exaudi ...</i> and <i>Et clamor ... veniat semper</i>, to match the style of the Mozarabic Office. In other words, add 'always' to <i>Let my cry ... to thee.</i></li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">When an Antiphon, Sono, Lauda, or Responsory begins, the first line is said by the Celebrant, and then repeated by the Choir. Then the Priest says the line marked P., and the Choir says the versicle, V.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">During the lessons, as in the minor hours, the Missa gothica directs a 'Dominus sit' before the first lesson, but none for any subsequent lessons, and none before the consequent hymn or Lauda, if it occurs.</li>

		<li style="text-align:left; background-color:#DDD; float:initial">The Modern Rubrics present us with a mix of ancient Mozarabic practices, its medieval additions, and modern tastes, evident in the new ranking system, the precedence of Sundays, the preference for the Temporale over the Sanctorale, and the non-transference of feasts.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">The 1775 Kalendar is rather sparse, with the 1502 feasts relegated to the back, deemed inauthentic. The former is malnourished, but the latter has too many overlapping feasts. Also in the 1502 Breviarium, St Bonaventure has been written in, showing that some innovation was still done in the Mozarabic chapel.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Feasts are organized into 6 Capparum, 4 Capparum, and 2 Capparum, although the last is usually called 9 Lessons. There are also octaves (called Gregorian Rule). 1603 tells us they correspond the the Roman ranks of Duplex, Semiduplex, and Simple. In Spanish, Capparum has been translated as capas, which means layers. However, using the term copes, levels, grades, or degrees could also be accurate. The rank of Sundays is unknown.<!--  If Roman, then 4 layer feasts are transferred on Sundays, but Sundays outrank 9 lesson feasts, but are all outranked by 6 layers. But I suspect that Sundays only outrank 9 lessons, if at all, given that there are only three Sundays after Pentecost. --></li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">1603 and Missa gothica state that the final Commemoratio of Vespers, Compline and Lauds is not to be said on feasts of 4 layers, 6 layers, or Octaves. They are similar in concept to Roman Suffrages. But the Missa gothica still lists them after 4/6 layer feasts.</li>
		<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial">The modern rubrics informs us Advent starts on the Sunday nearest to St. Aciscli, from the 13th to the 19th, while CATHEN informs us that it starts the Sunday after St Martin's, anywhere from the 12th to the 18th of November, following the Ambrosian practice. But CATHEN likely has it wrong, as unlike the Milanese, it avoids placing the 24th on a Sunday.</li> -->
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">The modern rubrics informs us Advent starts on the Sunday nearest to St. Aciscli, from the 13th to the 19th, while CATHEN informs us that it starts the Sunday after St Martin's, anywhere from the 12th to the 18th of November, following the Ambrosian practice. The back of the 1500 Missale simply refers that Advent is kept as at Milan, so it is likely that the new rubrics are an innovation, in an effort to keep the Eve from taking the Sunday.</li>

		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">On the 6th of August. Ss. Justi & Pastoris is without rank on both Kalendars. Rank unknown. In 1502, probably 9 lessons. Proper & occurence with Transfiguration.</li>

		<li style="text-align:left; background-color:#DDD; float:initial"><a  style="padding:0px; display:inline; background-color:#DDD; pointer-events:auto" target="_blank" href="aa_gothicum_ante_post.txt">Ante & Post</a>: Raw text from the Missa gothica, with some comparison to Breviarium and Roman Office.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Post Laudes: Added 'Dominus sit ...' to Alma Redemptoris. Throughout the year, sources say default to Salve, but the accompanying prayer is unknown. If Concede, then say as in Post Nonam (Omit Dignare ...). But there is also the distinct option of using Roman: Omnipotens. 'Francis' refers to the Primate of Spain, and the Archbishop of Toledo. For Post Trinity, copied from post-None.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">All hours: Following the Missa gothica, and other sources, an Ave Maria is added before all hours.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">All Matins: Added Ave Regina from Missa gothica, even on Sundays. It is unknown why the Missa gothica prescribes Ave Regina and includes it in the back, but the main text does not reference it. Of course, it is possible that the Pater and Ave are supposed to be duplicated.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Oratio Conclusion: will default to 'Per misericordiam tuam ...'</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">As the Breviarium only directs that psalms end with Gloria, et honor, ... Sicut erat ..., only three times, and that on this point it contradicts the Missa gothica, it seems like a Romanization. Therefore, Psalms and Canticles will not end with Sicut erat ... .</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Psalms 50, 148, 149, 150, and the Benedictus are different between the Breviarium, Psalter and the Missa gothica.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">The Missa gothica itself is not consistent. For example, the Benedictus is given five times, and each time is slightly different with grammatical and word variations. The same can be said for the psalms, though I have only checked 50 and 148-149-150.</li>
		<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Currently, the pages use the Breviarium text, except for psalms 3, 50, and 56, which are from the Psalter in the Breviarium. I.E., not the Missa gothica.</li> -->
		<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial">There is the issue of whether psalms end with Gloria, et honor, ... Sicut erat ..., or Gloria, et honor, ... in sÃ¦cula sÃ¦culorum. The Missa gothica contradicts the Breviarium on this point, as Sicut only appears at most eight times in the whole Breviarium. I am leaning towards not including it, as it seems like a Romanization. The Missa gothica itself is not consistent. For example, the Benedictus is given five times, and each time is slightly different. And it seems that, unlike Roman and in the Breviary, a Gloria is added after the Benedictus.</li> -->
		<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial">But as of yet, wherever Sicut is, it is kept.</li> -->
		<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Commemorations need to be clarified.</li> -->
		<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial">The Missa gothica suggests that the Lauda Antiphon is repeated after 148-149-150.</li> -->
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Lauda: When 148-149-150 is said, the antiphon is repeated in full. Not written in Breviarium, but following Missa gothica.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">When Psalm 150 is by itself, the antiphon is split at the end. When it is split, Gloria is not added after the psalm, but as in between the split antiphons.</li>
		<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Let's compromise. Because 148-150 is written, use it for First Sunday of Advent only. All others will use the psalter in the breviary. Except for ps 50, which will be decided later. The missa will not really be used, as it is not consistent, but I might typeset that one day.</li> -->
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">The Benedictus is based off of the Missa gothica, since the one provided in the Breviarium is alone in variation of translation, principally aquÃ¦ vs atque, the former of which is actually in the Bible. Additionally, the Missa gothica adds a Gloria, except for once (out of five). Breviarium and Roman do not include Gloria. It is unknown whether the Missa is wrong.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Benedictus: Gloria, et honor ..., is added at the end, based from Missa gothica.</li>
		<li style="text-align:left; background-color:#DDD; float:initial">In Psalm 50, the main differences are delictis vs peccatis. The mockup uses the Breviarium. <a style="padding:0px; display:inline; background-color:#DDD; pointer-events:auto" target="_blank" href="aa_50.html">Comparison</a></li>

			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Sol Angelorum has some minor differences with Missa gothica, but they are minor and not written here. Same with Cultor Dei.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Split post Hymn versicle, as Missa gothica. This could have been done in other hours, as noted.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Missa gothica adds Gloria to Ps 90. Breviarium is silent.</li>
			<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial">According to CATHEN, alia Supplicatio at Compline means there are three of them. But Missa gothica, 1593, and 1603 direct one, so it is possible that the alia means there is a festal, ferial, and Sunday version.</li> -->
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">There are three choices for Supplicatio. CATHEN directs all three, but it is probably wrong. 1603 directs one and Missa gothica chooses the first. Again, possible festal/Sunday/ferial arrangement.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Breviarium gives Oratio conclusion at Blessing (tuam), but so does Missa gothica, but this is changed to the usual for consistency.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Split Commemoration verse as Missa gothica.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">No dominus sit before Oratio, as Breviarium adds one after.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Missa gothica: quiescamus vs Breviarium requiescamus.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Breviarium directs a Pater after the Commemoration. Missa gothica does not, as it ends at this point. It is unknown whether it is a private or public recitation. To avoid duplication, and following Roman praxis, a simple recitation.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">1603 Directs Salve and Missa gothica provides it.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">As mentioned above, at this point, Compline gets complex and hard to interpret. The rubric given is unclear, and there seems to be two versions at play here.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">It is my opinion that Compline as given here so far has been Cathedral and the latter texts are Monastic, as they are similar in structure to the other minor hours, leading to this confusing mix.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Treating this as a separate rite, this is separated on its own.</li>

			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">It is unclear whether the Responsory replaces Sol Angelorum or Cultor Dei. It seems that Cultor Dei is more likely, since Ps 90 follows Sol Angelorum.</li>
			<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial"></li> -->
			<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial"></li> -->
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Outside of Lent, there are no Lauda choices, so omit or say with Alleluia. Perhaps exclusive to Lent?</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">For the Traditione Lauda, it is unclear how much is repeated at the final P. Laus.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">CATHEN is just as baffled.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Next, six hymns are presented, with generic themes, so again, maybe a festal/Sunday/ferial split, MWF arrangement, or ad libitum choice, except the second last, which is for Lent, and the last for Sundays.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">After the hymns, say Ps 50, a Versicle, Kyrie, Pater and Deus, miserere. This part is copied from Aurora. There is no supplication, but Compline (Modern) offers several choices.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Ps 50 is said with Gloria, but for Lent and Sundays, it is not clear.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Deus, miserere ... does not reference anything, but it is reminiscent of the Aurora prayer, as copied. Also, it is something present in the manuscripts, which did not get compiled into the Breviarium.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">In Lent and on Sundays, after the hymn, simply say Ps 50 and the Versicle. Then it is unclear what to say. Most likely follow the above arrangement, saying the generic prayers.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">For ferias, the proper Chapter and Miserationes are said. These are recited in a manner of anticipation similar to Vespers, for example, on Friday night, recite the of Saturday.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">For some reason, two Friday Chapter and Blessing choices.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">Added Priest responses to Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday Miserationes. Fixed Thursday initial.</li>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">The following choices will be made:</li>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc !important; overflow:visible; display:inline-block; pointer-events:none; margin-left:45px;">
				<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">On Saturdays and feasts, there is no Chapter, but a Pater Noster is immediately said. If one wishes to recite a chapter, see Compline (Modern).</li>
				<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">On ferial days, see the list of proper Chapters.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">After the Petitio, if a Chapter has been said, then say "Humiliate vos ..." as per usual. If not, then omit, because there is no Blessing.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">On ferias and during the Tradition of the Lord, there is a proper Miserationes.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">In Lent, there is a prayer said after the Miserationes, given at the end of the Miserationes page.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">On Saturdays and feasts, say one of the Preces.</li>
				<!-- <li style="text-align:left; float:initial"></li> -->
				</ul>
			<li style="text-align:left; float:initial">It is unclear whether these are said specically in Lenten ferias or ordinary ferias as well. Following the directions at the end of Compline, it seems that these would be said regardless of season.</li>
